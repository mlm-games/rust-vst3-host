# VST3 primer

A short mental model of VST3, for readers new to the format. You don't need this to use the
library — it hides these details — but it explains the vocabulary that shows up in plugin
metadata and the API.

## A plugin is a bundle of classes

A `.vst3` file is a bundle (a directory on macOS/Windows, a shared library inside). It
exports a **factory** that lists one or more **classes**. The one that matters for hosting
is the *Audio Module Class* — the actual effect or instrument.
`get_detailed_plugin_info` reports the factory identity and the full class list.

## Two halves: processor and controller

A VST3 plugin separates audio processing from its UI and parameter model:

- The **component / audio processor** (`IComponent` / `IAudioProcessor`) does the DSP. It
  has audio and event (MIDI) **buses** and a `process` call.
- The **edit controller** (`IEditController`) owns the parameters and the editor view.

Some plugins implement both halves in one class ("single component"); others ship them
separately. The library handles both and presents one `Plugin` either way.

## Everything is normalized

VST3 parameters are always `0.0–1.0` on the wire. The plugin maps that to its real range
(Hz, dB, an enum) internally. That's why `Parameter::value` is normalized and why you ask
the plugin to render a display string with `format_parameter` rather than computing it
yourself. See [Control parameters](../how-to/control-parameters.md).

## Buses and channels

A plugin declares audio **buses** (each with a channel count) and event buses for MIDI. An
instrument typically has one audio output bus and one event input bus; an effect has audio
input and output buses. `PluginInfo` summarizes the counts; `get_detailed_plugin_info`
gives the full per-bus layout.

## MIDI is mostly events, but not entirely

Note on/off and polyphonic pressure are first-class VST3 events. Control change, pitch bend
and channel pressure are not: the plugin declares through `IMidiMapping` which of *its own
parameters* each controller drives, and the host sends a parameter change instead. The
library does that translation for you — and drops the controller if the plugin declares no
mapping for it, because there is nothing valid to send. Program changes are not MIDI events
either; they go through program lists (`IUnitInfo`), so `MidiEvent::ProgramChange` is routed
to the root unit's program-change parameter. See [Send MIDI](../how-to/send-midi.md).
